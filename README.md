# Control LEDs with Telegram Bot using ESP32

## üìå Project Overview
This project allows you to control LEDs using an ESP32 board via a Telegram bot. By sending specific commands through Telegram, you can turn LEDs on and off remotely.

## üöÄ Features
- Control up to 4 LEDs via Telegram commands
- Secure communication using WiFi and Telegram API
- Real-time LED state monitoring

## üõ† Components Required
- **ESP32 Board**
- **4 LEDs**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Telegram Account**

## üîß Setup Instructions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for `BotFather`.
2. Start a chat and type `/newbot`.
3. Follow the instructions to set up the bot and get your **API Token**.
4. Save the bot token for later use.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in the Arduino IDE:
- `WiFi.h`
- `WiFiClientSecure.h`
- `UniversalTelegramBot.h`
- `ArduinoJson.h`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Update WiFi & Bot Credentials
Modify these lines in the code with your credentials:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
#define BOTtoken "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
#define CHAT_ID "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Code to ESP32
1. Connect ESP32 to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and select the correct board and port.
3. Upload the provided `.ino` file.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to check for successful WiFi and Telegram connections.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Telegram Commands
Once the ESP32 is running, send these commands to your bot:
- `/led1_on` - Turns LED 1 ON
- `/led1_off` - Turns LED 1 OFF
- `/led2_on` - Turns LED 2 ON
- `/led2_off` - Turns LED 2 OFF
- `/led3_on` - Turns LED 3 ON
- `/led3_off` - Turns LED 3 OFF
- `/led4_on` - Turns LED 4 ON
- `/led4_off` - Turns LED 4 OFF
- `/state` - Shows the current LED status
